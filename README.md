# WebProject_NetFramework
Online Admission System - AsaanApply. This is a Web Development Project developed in Asp.NET Framework MVC. 
The app has a homepage where information of the university is available and different tabs which user can click to perform different actions.

The user can sign sign up for registration.
After signing up, they are required to log in with their username and password.
All the fields have relevant javascript validations attached to them so the user cannot enter invalid data in the fields.

After signing in, they can see a student dashboard infront of them which contains their information and current application status. The user can click on Profile and change their basic info as well.
They can then navigate to the tab named application form which contains multiple sections. The students are required to fill in all the sections to be able to submit their admission application.

After the application is submitted, the students can navigate to the status tab in the left pane to see the status of their application. For testing purposes we generated a challan which the user can download to pay for their test fee.
